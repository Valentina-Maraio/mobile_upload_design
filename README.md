## Sign Your PDF - Web App

A **mobile-friendly web application** that allows users to upload a PDF, send it to a mock server simulating digital signing, and display the signed PDF for download or viewing on both mobile and desktop devices.

This project uses a modern frontend stack with **React, Vite, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS**, combined with a **Node.js Express backend** to mock the signing process by stamping a signature text on the PDF.

## Features

- Upload PDF files directly from mobile or desktop devices.
- Send PDF to a mock backend server that adds a visible "Signed by Mock Server" stamp.
- View signed PDF in-browser with inline preview (desktop/tablet) or open in a new tab (mobile)
- Download the signed PDF file
- Responsive and accessible UI design optimised for phones, tablets, and desktops-
- File removal option to select a different PDF before signing.
- CORS-enabled backend for cross-origin requests during development

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Multer, pdf-lib (for mock signing)
- **Development:** ESModules, modern JS, responsive design.
